=== { Pre-Alpha 1.2937 - [15/05/2020] ~Roles v2 + Channels~
### Added
[✓] - Ability to Create Roles
[✓] - Ability to Assign Roles to Users
[✓] - Role Permissions
        Issue to adress: When changing role name, the refrence on the database has a name which is different to the changed name. 
        Even when doing so, the line 1330 the name is set to the Id of the role, this means that the array on the personals database
        is not the same name as refrenced by the role name on the server. For this reason, you cannot chanage the name of the server for now.

[•] - Server Channels

# Fortitude
Simple, Easy, Intuitive and Well Performing Chat Application in pre-alpha phase of development.

## About Me
Hi my name is Ben White and I am a student and self-taught devloper who has shared a great interest and liking with the popular gamer messaging platform, discord.
I wanted a progect, and something to do and as it happened my school had just blocked this popular messaging app so i decided to take it upon myself to create my own.

This is where Fortitude comes in.
Fortitude is my discord clone, however I have scowered the internet with great interest to find other features that many people have been requesting for such as custom color themes and more that I decided to implement.

This site is hosted on firebase [link](https://fortitude.unrealben.repl.co/) with a repl.it forwarder to redirect to the most recent site.
This site folows the developmental release schedule and has updates every month or two. I will later release a stable (public) release build and a more buggy experimental build for those who deem themselves worthy.
